# powerfetch
PowerShell-based cross-platform 'screenfetch'-like tool

### About

1. This script is made for Windows 10 v1703 and newer, I don't test it on old Windows versions
2. Likewise I am currently only testing Linux compatibility on Ubuntu 16.04 and 17.04
3. The macOS and Linux compatibility is definitely very much still work in progress
4. Requires [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell "PowerShell GitHub page")
5. The windows-flag ASCII artwork used in this script is based on nijikokun's in [WinScreeny](https://github.com/nijikokun/WinScreeny "WinScreeny GitHub page") that I used with explicit permission
