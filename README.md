# powerfetch
PowerShell-based cross-platform 'screenfetch'-like tool

### About

1. This script is made for Windows 10 v1703 and newer, I don't test it on old Windows versions
2. Likewise I am currently only testing Linux compatibility on Ubuntu 16.04 and 17.04
3. This is definitely very much a work in progress
4. Requires [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell "PowerShell GitHub page")
