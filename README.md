### About

1. This script requires at least Windows 10 v1703 to display correctly
2. The macOS and Linux compatibility is definitely very much still work in progress
3. Requires [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell "PowerShell GitHub page")
4. The windows-flag ASCII artwork used in this script is based on nijikokun's in [WinScreeny](https://github.com/nijikokun/WinScreeny "WinScreeny GitHub page") that I used with explicit permission
